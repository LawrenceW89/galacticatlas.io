        <p><strong>Galactic Atlas</strong> is an interactive, ever-expanding map of our galaxy ‚Äî a digital star chart where you can explore real stars, exoplanets, and systems discovered by missions like Kepler, TESS, and the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>

        <p>üõ∞Ô∏è Built to grow alongside humanity's exploration of the stars, this project aims to combine:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Accurate, up-to-date astronomical data</li>
          <li>A beautiful, responsive, map-based UI</li>
          <li>Community-powered contributions and insights</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Think: <strong>Google Maps for the Milky Way</strong>, curated like <strong>Wikipedia</strong>, visualised like <strong>No Man's Sky</strong> ‚Äî but rooted in reality.</p>

        <p>This is a personal passion project in its early stages. For now, it's a placeholder site, but the mission is clear: bring the galaxy to your browser.</p>

        <p>üî≠ Stay tuned!</p>
