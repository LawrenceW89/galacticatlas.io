# 🌌 Galactic Atlas

**Galactic Atlas** is an interactive, ever-expanding map of our galaxy — a digital star chart where you can explore real stars, exoplanets, and systems discovered by missions like Kepler, TESS, and the James Webb Space Telescope.

🛰️ Built to grow alongside humanity’s exploration of the stars, this project aims to combine:
- Accurate, up-to-date astronomical data
- A beautiful, responsive, map-based UI
- Community-powered contributions and insights

Think: **Google Maps for the Milky Way**, curated like **Wikipedia**, visualised like **No Man’s Sky** — but rooted in reality.

This is a personal passion project in its early stages. For now, it's a placeholder site, but the mission is clear: bring the galaxy to your browser.

🔭 Stay tuned!
